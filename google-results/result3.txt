0The Pursuit of Happyness StorylineEditDid you knowEditTriviaRyan's hallucination of seeing Kowalski again in the space pod was George Clooney's idea.

According to Clooney, Alfonso Cuarón was unable to come up with a satisfactory resolution for the character despite many revisions of the scene, including removing the dialogue, until Clooney offered to take a shot at rewriting the scene himself.

GoofsWhen Kowalski asks Stone to let go of him because the rope will not hold them both, that could never happen because they are both in the same orbit around the earth.

A short simple tug would have brought him back to her.

Additionally, once they are drifting away from the ISS, disconnecting from Kowalski would not cause her to rebound back toward the ISS unless another force pulled her back in its direction.

At most she would stop when the ropes reach the end of their slack, in which case Kowalsky would also have stopped.

QuotesMatt Kowalski: Listen, do you wanna go back, or do you wanna stay here? I get it.

It's nice up here.

You can just shut down all the systems, turn out all the lights, and just close your eyes and tune out everyone.

There's nobody up here that can hurt you. It's safe.

I mean, what's the point of going on? What's the point of living? Your kid died.

Doesn't get any rougher than that. But still, it's a matter of what you do now.

If you decide to go, then you gotta just get on with it.

Sit back, enjoy the ride.

You gotta plant both your feet on the ground and start livin' life.

Hey, Ryan? It's time to go home.

2KReviewReviewFeatured review8/10 A visual technical and directorial achievement, but there is much more to 'Gravity' than those thingsTo me, 'Gravity' may not quite the masterpiece that it has been touted to be, though the critics and positive reviews do a fantastic job summing up the film's merits.

However, while it is easy to see why some won't like it it is nowhere near as bad from personal opinion as the negative reviewers say.

It is nowhere near the worst film ever and not deserving of a 1/10 rating with the visuals, effects and direction being such an achievement, the trend to bash critics and those who agree with the general consensus has also become extremely annoying.

Alfonso Cuaron is is an extremely talented director, all his films to date have proved that.

'Children of Men' is especially good and one of the best films of the decade, have always have had a huge soft spot for 'A Little Princess', 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' is not for everyone but for me it was a near-masterpiece, 'Prisoner of Azkaban' is one of the best directed films of the 'Harry Potter' franchise and as polarising as 'Gravity' is there is no denying that Cuaron's direction and the visuals were exceptional.

'Gravity' may be my second least favourite film of his, with 'Prisoner of Azaban', still very good, faring least, this is saying little and is testament to Cuaron's talent.

'Gravity' does fall short of perfection.

Its weak spot is the script, it does tend to ramble, feel manufactured and cheesy and doesn't do an awful lot to make the characters more than mere clichés.

The story doesn't always grip with a few slow, dull spots, and the ending puzzles.

However, as said already in this review and by previous reviews (acknowledged in most less than positive postings, 'Gravity' is a triumph visually and technically.

The cinematography is tremendous, quite possibly the most beautiful and best shot film of 2013.

The setting is striking and the special effects are a marvel.

Cuaron's direction is exceptional, some of the best he has ever done, a master of visuals and mood.

With that being said, 'Gravity' has much more to it than the visuals and direction.

The music is an incredible fit, it's haunting, sweeping and breathtakingly beautiful.

A good deal of the story is gripping, with intimacy, tension and great emotional impact.

Sandra Bullock gives one of her finest performances here and gives the film a certain grace, while George Clooney has a cool calmness that fits his role perfectly.

Ed Harris is also impressive.

Overall, an achievement visually, technically and directorially, but despite its faults 'Gravity' is much more than those things.
